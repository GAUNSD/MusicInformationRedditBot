# MusicInformationRedditBot
Author: Gustavo Murcia


A Reddit bot that replies to someone who mentions a musician, with said musicians top playlist result from google, and their wikipedia article. 
Currently, the bot will only look at comments that contain a mention of the artis for a list of West Coast Rappers (taken from the [List of West Coast hip hop artists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_West_Coast_hip_hop_artists)). This will of course be expanded to other artists in the future

TODO:

*Change it so names of artists with numbers as their first character are recognized

*Change it so that the comments are parsed for their content. This way the comments just mentioning an artist will also recieve the reply from the bot
